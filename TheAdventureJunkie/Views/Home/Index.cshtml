			For many years, Bethany has been baking the most delicious pies at her home.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 2013, we opened our first store in Brussels (Belgium) in a cosy little street
			near the Grand Market. People from all over the world fell in love with the soft
			cakes, heavenly cheese cakes, spicy apple pies... The store became a success in no time.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 2015, no less than 100 pies were sold every day and Bethany's Pie Shop moved into a larger
			building. After receiving many requests, it became clear that our next step was making it possible to order
			pies from the comfort of your own home and from anywhere in the world. You are now looking at the
			result of this: our very own online store, making it possible to order Bethany's delicious pies whenever you feel like
			it!
